- 👋 Hi, I’m @martinlanton
- 👀 I’m interested in rigging for vfx, animation and video games, as well as development of tools and plugins for those areas.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced concept in Qt (such as unit testing for drag and drop behavior), as well as scala (just for fun)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on advanced framework for data management in rigging.
- 📫 How to reach me : lantonmartin@gmail.com

martinlanton/martinlanton is a ✨ special ✨ repository because I'm a special boy with big boy pants (joke aside, it's just because its `README.md` (this file) appears on my GitHub profile, and I'm such a big boy that I need to keep this sentence there to remember it :D)
